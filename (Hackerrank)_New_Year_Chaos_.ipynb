        "Then, construct a secondary loop from `max(0, q[i] -2)` up to `i`. This helps us check all possible persons before `i`. Think of the iterator `j` as the index for an array where everything is sorted and no one bribed.  Whenver `q[j] > q[i]`, we know that person `j` has overtaken `i` so we add 1 to the number of overtakes. If the program is not terminated, report the number of overtakes.\n",
